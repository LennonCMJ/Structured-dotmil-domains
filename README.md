# Purpose
This repository was built only for research purposes in accordance with https://hackerone.com/deptofdefense?view_policy=true.
If you interested in contributing or research - make sure you read it.

# Relevance
All listed domains was alive at the moment of publication (bad records was filtered - domains with DNS errors, ConnectFailure, etc.). We will check and update the lists in the future.
The domains with 403, 404, 401, 500 codes, TrustFailure or other SSL problems was listed too.

# Testing
Some subdomains is not accessible on port 80, so `https://` prefix is required upon testing. Avoid the using of automated tools - DoD firewalls can block your IP address end even IP pool, and you loose access to the some part of domains. If you still want to use it - make sure that you set the delay between responses (2-3 sec. minimum).
